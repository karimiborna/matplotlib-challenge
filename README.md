# matplotlib-challenge

This repository contains the work for the Module 5 challenge, done by myself in collaboration with Vinayak Shankar, Sencer Senyurt, and Ahmed Abusamra.
The analysis is included in the file, analysis.txt, within the Pymaceuticals directory which the main code is in.
The .ipynb-checkpoints directory can be ignored.
